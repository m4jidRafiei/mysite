title: Machine Learning for Process mining
summary: In this project, the goal is to support and comprehend process mining results such as process models with predictive machine learning techniques. An example is to predict deviations from the reference model as early as possible. All the machine learning techniques are supported by explainable AI (XAI) to add transparency to decisions made by black-box models.
