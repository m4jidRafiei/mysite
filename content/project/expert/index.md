title: Finding Experts in Online Communities (Expert Finding)
summary: An online community is a virtual community where people can express their opinions and their knowledge freely. There is a great deal of information in online communities. However, there is no way to determine its authenticity. Thus, the knowledge which has been shared in online communities is not reliable. The goal of this project is to determine the expertise level of users and find experts in online communities in order to evaluate the accuracy of posted comments.
